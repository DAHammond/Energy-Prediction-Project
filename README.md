# Energy-Prediction-Project
A small project forcasting future energy costs using existing smart meter data

## How to use the Jupyter Notebook:
1. Download the consumption data from the desired period from the Octopus Energy Website (be aware that if the dataset is not for an entire year, the consumption patterns may not be representative for the entire years costs. Also, be aware that your consumption habits may change after changing tariff e.g. charging an electric car over a certain time of day)
2. Move the CSV file into the same folder that this notebook is in
3. Change the name of the CSV file in the setup section of this notebook so the correct data is being imported
4. Make sure that the tariffs and prices are correct for the available options for the correct postcode on the Octopus energy website (and the time periods have not changed)
5. Run the code and see the comparison
